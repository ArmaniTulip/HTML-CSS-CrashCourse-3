        <p>
            When a Function as a Service (FaaS) API is called, networking components are initialized to handle the communication between the client and the FaaS platform. 
            This involves establishing network connections, routing the API request, and transmitting the response. 
            Networking is a crucial component in enabling the interaction between the client and the FaaS platform during the API call.
